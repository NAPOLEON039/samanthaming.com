# HTML `<kbd>` Tag

Wrap your keyboard command text with `<kbd>`. Great to use especially in documentations! It's more semantically correct & allows you to target it to apply some nice styling. You can also use this tag for other user input such as voice input or any text entry device üôå

_HTML_

```html
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
```

> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>

### Styling

_CSS_

```css
kbd {
  border: 1px solid lime;
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

_Output_

> <kbd style="border: 1px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;padding: 5px;">ctrl</kbd>

## Default Styling

Here's how it looks like without any styling:

```html
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>

<p>Ctrl</p>
```



_Output_

> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
> <p>Ctrl</p>

As you can tell, it looks quite plain üòÖ. It just has the **monspace** font. If you open it up in your dev tools, this is what you will get:

```css
/* Default Style */
kbd {
  font-family: monospace;
}
```

#### Auto Styling in GitHub Markdown

But there is something interesting I discovered. If you use the standard `<kbd>` in GitHub's markdown, it looks very similar to the style I have in my code tidbit. This is great to add some pizzaz to your *README* files üíÉ. Another reason to use the correct HTML tags üòÜ

## Use Case

This is super useful when writing documentations. I remember I used to always just use the `<code>` tag and then apply some sort of class to target it for styling. But after doing some googling, I found a more semantic solution, `<kbd>`. That's why Google is a programmer's best friend üòÇ

‚ùå Bad

```html
To copy text, you can use the keyboard shortcut:

<code>Ctrl</code> + <code>c</code>
```

‚úÖ Good

```html
To copy text, you can use the keyboard shortcut:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
```

## `code` vs `kbd`

So I mentioned that I use to use the `<code>` tag. Let's look at what that does.

| `<code>`          | `<kbd>`         |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| <code>Ctrl</code> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> |
| monospace         | monospace       |

From your browser, it might not make any difference with the default styling. They are both using the `monospace` font-family. But semantically, they are identified differently.

**`<kbd>`**: Text that indicates user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device.

**`<code>`**: Text that indicates a short fragment of a computer code.

_[@percy_burton](https://twitter.com/Percy_Burton/status/1190978043105435648?s=20):_ Learnt more about fieldset recently. Thought it was just for radio buttons or checkboxes, but can be to group any related form items, I believe. Great for Accessibility too üòÄ

_[@JelteHomminga](https://twitter.com/JelteHomminga/status/1190991861705531392?s=20):_ And useful to set the whole set of fields to disabled instead of doing that for each input separately
